# MADSm2
This is a repo for sentence simplification as part of a milestone project created by Christian Dallago and myself.  

There are source ipynb files for our work in Jupyter notebooks and the bsrc file which uses a pytorch model that has been adapted for this purpose from the original repo which can
be found at https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur/bert-sentiment.
